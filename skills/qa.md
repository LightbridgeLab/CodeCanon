> **QA workflow is not configured.** `/qa` requires `QA_READY_LABEL` to be set in `.codecannon.yaml` so it can find issues waiting for QA.

> To enable: add `QA_READY_LABEL: ready-for-qa` (or your preferred label name) to `.codecannon.yaml` and re-run `CodeCannon/sync.sh`.

> Note: In trunk mode, `/submit-for-review` does not apply this label automatically — you would need to apply it manually or via a separate workflow.

## What `/qa` does

`/qa` has two modes:

- **No argument** — show all issues awaiting QA.
- **Numeric argument** — walk through QA review for a specific issue.

---

## Mode A — No argument: QA queue view

Run:
```
gh issue list --label "{{QA_READY_LABEL}}" --state open \
  --json number,title,url,labels,milestone,assignees
```

Display as a numbered list. For each issue show: issue number, title, milestone (if set), and URL.

If the list is empty, say:

> "No issues are currently waiting for QA."

Do not take any other action.

---

## Mode B — Numeric argument: Review a specific issue

The argument is an issue number. Work through the following steps.

### Step 1 — Load context

```
gh issue view <number> --json number,title,body,labels,url,comments
```

Display the issue title and body.

Check whether `{{QA_READY_LABEL}}` is currently applied to the issue. If it is **not** present, warn:

> "Issue #N does not have the {{QA_READY_LABEL}} label. It may not be deployed to preview yet. Continue anyway? (yes/no)"

Wait. If the user says no, stop.

---

### Step 2 — Review prompt

Say:

> "Test this feature on the preview environment. When you're done, describe what you tested, what you found, and your verdict (pass or fail). Include screenshots if you have them — paste image links or drag-and-drop into GitHub directly."

**Stop. Wait for the QA person's input. Do not proceed until they provide a verdict.**

---

### Step 3 — Post findings as issue comment

Build a structured comment from their input:

```
## QA Review

**Verdict:** PASS  (or FAIL)

**What was tested:**
<their description>

**Findings:**
<their findings, or "None — feature works as expected.">

**Screenshots:**
<image links if provided, or "None attached.">
```

Show the comment to the user before posting. Ask:

> "Post this to issue #N? (yes/no)"

Wait for confirmation. On yes:
```
gh issue comment <number> --body "<comment>"
```

On no, stop — do not post and do not apply labels.

---

### Step 4 — Apply verdict label

Based on the verdict:

**PASS:**
{{#if QA_PASSED_LABEL}}
```
gh issue edit <number> --add-label "{{QA_PASSED_LABEL}}" --remove-label "{{QA_READY_LABEL}}"
```
{{/if}}
{{#if !QA_PASSED_LABEL}}
```
gh issue edit <number> --remove-label "{{QA_READY_LABEL}}"
```
{{/if}}

**FAIL:**

Before applying labels, fetch the issue's current assignees:
```
gh issue view <number> --json assignees --jq '.assignees[].login' 2>/dev/null
```

If one or more assignees are found, prepend the following line to the comment body (above the `## QA Review` heading) in the comment that was already posted:

> cc @<assignee> — this issue needs attention.

If there are multiple assignees, include one `cc @<login>` per line. If the command errors or returns no results, omit the line silently.

{{#if QA_FAILED_LABEL}}
```
gh issue edit <number> --add-label "{{QA_FAILED_LABEL}}" --remove-label "{{QA_READY_LABEL}}"
```
{{/if}}
{{#if !QA_FAILED_LABEL}}
```
gh issue edit <number> --remove-label "{{QA_READY_LABEL}}"
```
{{/if}}

If the `gh issue edit` command fails because a label does not exist in the repo, report the error and say:

> "The label does not exist in this repository. Create it in GitHub Settings → Labels, then re-run `/qa <number>` from Step 4."

Do not retry automatically.

After applying labels, tell the user what was done:

- On PASS: "Issue #N marked as QA passed. The developer can now close it or promote to production."
- On FAIL: "Issue #N marked as QA failed. The developer will see the findings in the issue comments."

---

## Hard rules

- Never close an issue — verdict recording and closure are separate concerns.
- Never post the comment without showing it to the user first.
- Never apply labels without user confirmation (the confirmation in Step 3 is the single gate for both posting the comment and applying labels).
- Never merge, deploy, or take any action beyond labeling and commenting.
